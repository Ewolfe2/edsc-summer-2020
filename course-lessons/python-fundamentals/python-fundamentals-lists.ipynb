    "## What are Python Lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Python** list is a data structure that stores a collection of values in a specified order (or sequence). **Python** lists are mutable, which means that they can be changed or updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting feature of **Python** lists is that they can store data of different types, including a mix of `int`, `float`, `str`, etc, values, all in the same list.  You can even create a list that is composed of other lists!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each value in a list is called an item.  Since lists are sequences of items in a specified order, there is a label for the location (i.e. order number) of each item in the list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This order label is referred to as an index. Indexing allows lists to be iterable, meaning that you can access the each item in list, in the order in which they appear in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Index in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Python**, indexing is used by many data structures, such as lists, to organize data and manage the order of the items within the data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, **Python** indexing will always begin at `[0]`, rather `[1]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the first item in a **Python** list has an index `[0]`, the second item in a list has an index `[1]`, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the index of an item to query its value. For example, you can use the index `[1]` to get the value for the 2nd item (`0.75`) in the following list of values (`0.70, 0.75, 1.85`). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create Python Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously in this chapter, you learned how to create variables to store single data values such as `boulder_precip_in = 20.68`, which contained the the average annual precipitation in inches (in) in Boulder, Colorado. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a **Python** list, you use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`list_name = [item_1, item_2, item_3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the values (soon to be items in a list) are enclosed within brackets `[]` and are separated from each other using commas `,`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to defining variables, you do not have to define what types of values will be stored in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can create lists of numeric values such as `floats`. "
